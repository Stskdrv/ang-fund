ðŸ“š Home Task
In this task, you will create an app routing, authorization mechanism and glue all the app with help of services.

1. Implement app-routing.module.ts with lazy load modules
   Implement app-routing.module.ts with such lazy load modules:

Login page (/login route)
Registration page (/registration) route
[default / fallback url] Courses page with a list of courses (/courses route)
Add page for adding a new course (/courses/add route)
Add page for showing an existing course (/courses/:id route, where id â€“ course id)
Add page for editing an existing course (/courses/edit/:id route, where id â€“ course id) 2. Implement authorization
EXPLANATION
Implement authorization by creating auth module

Generate auth module with help of Angular CLI in src/app folder.

Implement session-storage.service.ts:

Generate session-storage.service.ts with help of Angular CLI in /src/app/auth/services folder.
Inject Window with help of @Inject decorator inside service.
Implement setToken(token: string), getToken and deleteToken methods which should use sessionStorage.
Implement auth.service.ts:

Generate auth.service.ts with help of Angular CLI in /src/app/auth/services folder.
According to Swagger of backend app implement login, logout and register methods which should make API calls.
Create a pair of properties (private Behaviour subject isAuthorized$$ + public Observable isAuthorized$) for isAuthorised state.
session-storage.service.ts should be used inside auth.service.ts methods for operations with token.
Implement guards:

Generate authorized.guard.ts & not-authorized.guard.ts with help of Angular CLI in /src/app/auth/guards folder.
Guards should use auth.service.ts for checking if user is authorized.
authorized.guard.ts should implement canLoad interface. In case if user is authorized guard returns true, if not - redirects to /login with help of UrlTree.
not-authorized.guard.ts should implement canActivate interface. In case if user is not authorized guard returns true, if not - redirects to /courses with help of UrlTree.
Add guards usage:

Use authorized guard for /courses, /course/add, /course/edit/:id and /course/:id routes.
Use not-authorized guard for /login and /registration routes.
Implement token.interceptor.ts for adding token to requests in /src/app/auth/interceptors folder. In case when request has 401 error, logout and redirect to /login.

3. Implement authors API & store services
   Implement authors API & store services:

Generate authors.service.ts & authors-store.service.ts with help of Angular CLI in /src/app/services folder.
According to Swagger of backend app, implement getAll and addAuthor methods for authors.service.ts which should make API calls.
Implement mechanism of storing authors and reflecting loading state in authors-store.service.ts by creating getAll and addAuthor methods and using authors.service.ts inside them. Also, implement private properties isLoading$$ & authors$$ which should be Behavior subjects, in addition to provide access to those variables and to limit external control, make public properties isLoading$ & authors$ which should be just Observables (and could be got by calling .asObservable on earlier created Behaviour subjects). 4. Implement courses API & store services
Implement courses API & store services:

Generate courses.service.ts & courses-store.service.ts with help of Angular CLI in /src/app/services folder.

According to Swagger of backend app, implement following methods for courses.service.ts which should make API calls:

getAll
createCourse
editCourse
getCourse
deleteCourse
Implement mechanism of storing courses and reflecting loading state in courses-store.service.ts by creating following methods and using courses.service.ts inside them:

getAll
createCourse
editCourse
getCourse
deleteCourse
Implement private properties isLoading$$ & courses$$ which should be Behavior subjects, in addition to provide access to those variables and to limit external control, make public properties isLoading$ & courses$ which should be just Observables (and could be got by calling .asObservable on earlier created Behaviour subjects).

Implement method(s) for searching courses (in case of using those method(s) the data in courses$ variable should reflect current state)

5. Implement user module
   Implement user module:

Generate user.module.ts with help of Angular CLI in /src/app/user folder.

Implement user.service.ts & user-store.service.ts

Generate user.service.ts & user-store.service.ts with help of Angular CLI in/src/app/user/services folder.
According to Swagger of backend app, implement getUser method for user.service.ts which should make API call.
Implement mechanism of storing authors and reflecting isAdmin state in user-store.service.ts by creating getUser method and using user.service.ts inside it. Also, implement private properties name$$ & isAdmin$$ which should be Behavior subjects, in addition to provide access to those variables and to limit external control, make public properties name$ & isAdmin$ which should be just Observables (and could be got by calling .asObservable on earlier created Behaviour subjects).
Implement admin.guard.ts which should follow CanActivate interface and should return true in case if user is admin and redirect to /courses in case if user is not admin with help of UrlTree.

Add admin.guard.ts for /course/add and /course/edit/:id routes

6. Integrate earlier created components
   EXPLANATION
   Integrate earlier created components with pages and services:

Remove all earlier mocked data and replace it with the created services.
Implement search for courses page with help of courses.services.ts.
Show controls for editing/removing course only in case if user has isAdmin=true.
In case when user clicks on remove course button - show confirm modal window and delete course only in case of confirmation.
In case when user clicks on edit course button - redirect to edit course page of exact course.
In case when user clicks on show course button - redirect to course page of exact course.
Add course in case of submitting form on add new course page.
Update course in case of submitting form on edit course page.
